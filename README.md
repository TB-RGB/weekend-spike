# Solo Spike

This was a practice in learning more about some technologies that I'd like to encorporate into my solo app sprint.


## Multer, csvtojson, chart.js

multer to handle file upload, csvtojson to parse the files from the memory buffer, and then delete the file after the data has been sent to the db to update a table.

chart.js to do data visualization with dynamic charts.
